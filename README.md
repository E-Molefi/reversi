This application is a two-player version of the "Reversi" game in Java using Swing. 

Reversi is a two-player game in which the players place identical game pieces called disks on a rectangular board. Disks are light on one side and dark on the other. The objective of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display the player's colour when the last playable empty square is filled.
